I am Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Computer Science & Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/). I am looking forward to collaborating with researchers who are interested in Voice conversion, Neural Vocoder, TTS for normal, dysarthric, or children speech. My research interests are mainly focused on Speech Technology and Multimodal Learning. (especially Voice conversion and Speech Synthesis) with deep learning approaches. Thanks for the guidance by Dr [Mingjie Chen](https://github.com/MingjieChen), Dr [Yanpei Shi](https://dblp.org/pid/238/4847.html), Dr [Qiang Huang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OT2FXYkAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr [â€ªMd Asif Jalalin](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=Xnmge4IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) in the [SpandH Group at The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/spandh). Welcome to follow and cite their works.
